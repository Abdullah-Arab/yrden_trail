# YrdenTrail

## Introduction
YrdenTrail is a unique mobile application that combines the charm of open-source mapping with the adventurous spirit of video game exploration. Inspired by the mystique of the Witcher series, YrdenTrail offers users a novel way to explore their surroundings, revealing the map as they travel through previously uncharted areas, much like uncovering areas hidden by the 'fog of war' in a fantasy game.

## Features
- **Explore Mode:** Uncover hidden paths and locations as you move, with the map revealing itself in real-time.
- **Trail Memory:** Keep track of the areas you have explored with a visually distinct trail marker.
- **User Privacy:** Utmost importance placed on user data security and privacy.
- **Customizable View:** Choose different map themes and exploration markers.
- **Offline Availability:** Access maps even without an internet connection.
